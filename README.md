# Viktors portfolio

Hi, my name is Viktor, and I’m 32 years old. I have a deep passion for computers, and not too long ago, I discovered that I also have a passion for programming. In my free time, I enjoy spending time with my family. During the winter, we often go to the mountains for skiing, as it’s a shared interest among us all.
