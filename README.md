# Viktors portfolio
          My name is Viktor, and I have a strong passion for programming and
          computers. In my spare time, I have been teaching myself and exploring
          PHP and C#. In August 2024, I began a front-end development program,
          and In autumn 2025, I will start my internship (LIA).
